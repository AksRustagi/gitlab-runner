# GitLab Runner

This is the repository of the official GitLab Runner written in Go.
It runs tests and sends the results to GitLab.
[GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci) is the open-source
continuous integration service included with GitLab that coordinates the testing.
The old name of this project was GitLab CI Multi Runner but please use "GitLab Runner" (without CI) from now on.

![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/badges/master/build.svg)

## Runner and GitLab CE/EE compatibility

GitLab Runner >= 9.0 requires GitLab's API v4 endpoints, which were introduced in
GitLab CE/EE 9.0.

Because of this **Runner >= 9.0 requires GitLab CE/EE >= 9.0 and will not work
with older GitLab versions**.

Old API used by Runner will be still present in GitLab >= versions until August 2017.
Until then we will also support the v1.11.x version of Runner.

> This means that if you want to have a newer version of GitLab CE/EE but for some
reason you don't want to install newer version of Runner, 1.11.x will be still
maintained and will be working with GitLab CE/EE until August 2017. It may not
support some new features, but any bugs or security violations will be handled
as for the stable version.

### Closing issues and merge requests

GitLab is growing very fast and we have a limited resources to deal with reported issues
and merge requests opened by the community volunteers. We appreciate all the contributions
coming from our community. But to help all of us with issues and merge requests management
we need to create some closing policy.

If an issue or merge request has a ~"waiting for feedback" label and the response from the
reporter has not been received for 14 days, we can close it using the following response
template:

```
We haven't received an update for more than 14 days so we will assume that the
problem is fixed or is no longer valid. If you still experience the same problem
try upgrading to the latest version. If the issue persists, reopen this issue
or merge request with the relevant information.
```

### Version 0.5.0

Version 0.5.0 introduces many security related changes.
One of such changes is the different location of `config.toml`.
Previously (prior 0.5.0) config was read from current working directory.
Currently, when `gitlab-runner` is executed by `root` or with `sudo` config is read from `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml`.
If `gitlab-runner` is executed by non-root user, the config is read from `$HOME/.gitlab-runner/config.toml`.
However, this doesn't apply to Windows where config is still read from current working directory, but this most likely will change in future.

The config file is automatically migrated when GitLab Runner was installed from GitLab's repository.
**For manual installations the config needs to be moved by hand.**
